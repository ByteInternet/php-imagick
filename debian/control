Description: ImageMagick module for php5
 This package provides a wrapper for ImageMagick library
 directly from PHP scripts.
 .
 PHP5 is an HTML-embedded scripting language. Much of its syntax is borrowed
 from C, Java and Perl with a couple of unique PHP-specific features thrown
 in. The goal of the language is to allow web developers to write
 dynamically generated pages quickly.
